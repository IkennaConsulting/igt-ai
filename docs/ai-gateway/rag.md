# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)  is a design pattern that involves integrating a retrieval system with a generative model. The retrieval system is responsible for fetching relevant documents or information from a large corpus (for example, proprietary enterprise content) based on the input query. The generative model then uses this retrieved information to generate more accurate and contextually relevant responses. RAG is a way to mitigate hallucinations in LLMs by grounding their responses in factual data.
