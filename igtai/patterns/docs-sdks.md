# Docs and SDKs

## The problem

Developers integrating with AI gateways face a steep learning curve that extends beyond traditional API integration challenges. They must understand not only how to make HTTP calls and authenticate, but also how to construct effective prompts, select appropriate models, optimize token consumption, and navigate complex multi-modal capabilities across different providers. Without comprehensive documentation and well-designed client libraries, this complexity leads to poor integration patterns, inefficient implementations, and underutilization of gateway capabilities.

When developers lack clear guidance on prompt engineering, they produce verbose or poorly structured prompts that waste tokens and produce lower quality responses. Without understanding model selection criteria, they might route simple queries to expensive capable models or complex reasoning tasks to cheap fast models, leading to either runaway costs or poor user experiences. The absence of code examples and best practice templates forces each team to independently discover effective patterns through trial and error, duplicating effort across the organization.

Beyond initial implementation challenges, inadequate documentation creates ongoing operational problems. Teams cannot troubleshoot issues effectively, struggle to optimize performance, and fail to adopt new gateway features as they become available. This results in fragmented implementations where different teams reinvent solutions to common problems, making it difficult to establish organization-wide standards for AI integration quality and governance compliance.

## Forces

Several competing factors make developer documentation and SDK provisioning challenging for AI gateways:

**Multiple programming languages**: Organizations use diverse technology stacks including Python, JavaScript, Java, Go, C#, and others. Providing high-quality client libraries across all these languages requires significant engineering investment and ongoing maintenance as languages evolve and new frameworks emerge.

**Varying developer skill levels**: Some developers are experienced with AI and prompt engineering, while others are integrating AI capabilities for the first time. Documentation must serve both audiences without overwhelming beginners or boring experts. Tutorials need different depth than API references.

**API complexity and evolution**: AI gateway APIs expose numerous endpoints for inference, streaming, embeddings, fine-tuning, and administration. Each endpoint has multiple parameters with interdependencies and constraints. As gateway capabilities expand, documentation must stay synchronized with implementation without becoming unwieldy.

**Prompt engineering as specialized skill**: Effective prompting is part art, part science. Teaching developers to write good prompts requires more than API documentation - it needs conceptual guidance, examples across diverse use cases, and explanations of why certain patterns work. This knowledge is harder to systematize than documenting REST endpoints.

**Model-specific behaviors**: Different models respond differently to identical prompts, have varying capabilities, and require different optimization strategies. Documentation must help developers navigate this landscape without requiring them to become experts in every model's characteristics.

**Balance between abstraction and transparency**: SDKs should simplify integration by abstracting HTTP complexity, but they must also expose enough control for advanced use cases like custom retry logic, streaming optimizations, or provider-specific parameters. Finding the right abstraction level is difficult.

**Interactive exploration needs**: Developers learn faster through experimentation than reading static documentation. Providing interactive API explorers, playgrounds, and live examples requires infrastructure beyond traditional documentation tools.

**Keeping content current**: AI technology evolves rapidly. Provider models change, new capabilities emerge, best practices evolve, and pricing updates frequently. Documentation that becomes stale quickly loses credibility and value, but maintaining freshness requires continuous investment.

## Risk the pattern mitigates

This pattern primarily mitigates **[Poor observability](../risks.md#poor-observability)** from the IGT-AI operational and performance risks category.

When developers lack proper documentation and well-designed SDKs, they often implement AI integrations without adequate logging, monitoring, and error handling. Comprehensive documentation that includes observability best practices, SDKs with built-in logging and metrics instrumentation, and clear guidance on debugging AI applications improve the organization's ability to diagnose issues and understand usage patterns across all AI-consuming applications.

The pattern also mitigates **[Fractured audit trails](../risks.md#fractured-audit-trails)** risk. Good documentation and SDKs encourage consistent integration patterns across teams, including proper request tagging, user attribution, and metadata propagation. When developers follow documented best practices for including context in API calls, the gateway can maintain coherent audit trails showing who made what requests, when, and why. Without this guidance, different teams implement incompatible tracking approaches, making it impossible to reconstruct sequences of events during incident investigation or compliance audits.

Additionally, the pattern indirectly reduces **[Runaway costs](../risks.md#runaway-costs)** by providing prompt optimization guidance, token counting utilities, and cost estimation tools. Developers who understand how to write efficient prompts and choose appropriate models based on documented cost models make better decisions that prevent unnecessary expenses.

## How it works

AI gateway documentation and SDKs provide developers with the knowledge and tools they need to integrate effectively. While the infrastructure for delivering documentation and building client libraries is generic to all API platforms, the content within these resources is highly specific to AI gateway capabilities and challenges.

### API reference documentation

The gateway provides comprehensive API documentation covering all available endpoints, parameters, and response formats:

**Authentication and authorization**: Detailed explanation of how to obtain API keys or tokens, which authentication methods are supported (API keys, OAuth, JWT), how to scope permissions, and how to rotate credentials securely. Examples show proper header formatting and common authentication errors.

**Inference endpoints**: Complete specification of request and response schemas for text generation, chat completions, embeddings, and other AI operations. Documentation explains each parameter's effect on model behavior - for instance, how temperature affects randomness, what top-p sampling does, how max_tokens limits output length, and the trade-offs between different sampling strategies.

**Streaming interfaces**: Guidance on consuming streaming responses using server-sent events, including connection management, partial response handling, error recovery, and example code for common frameworks that simplifies the complexity of streaming implementation.

**Model catalog and capabilities**: Searchable reference listing all available models with detailed metadata including maximum context length, supported modalities (text, vision, audio), cost per token for input and output, typical latency characteristics, and recommended use cases. This helps developers choose appropriate models without needing to research provider documentation separately.

**Error handling**: Comprehensive error code reference explaining what each error means, common causes, and recommended remediation steps. For example, rate limit errors include guidance on implementing exponential backoff, token limit errors explain context window management, and authentication errors clarify credential configuration.

**Advanced features**: Documentation for capabilities like function calling, JSON mode, vision analysis, and prompt caching. Each feature includes parameter specifications, examples showing typical usage patterns, explanations of how the feature works internally, and guidance on when to use it versus alternatives.

### Interactive API explorer

A web-based interface allows developers to experiment with the gateway API without writing code:

**Live request builder**: Form-based interface where developers select models, enter prompts, adjust parameters using sliders and dropdowns, and immediately see the API request that would be generated. This helps developers understand request structure through experimentation.

**Real-time execution**: Developers can execute requests against the live gateway and see actual responses, including latency metrics, token consumption, and cost estimates. This provides immediate feedback on how parameter changes affect results and expenses.

**Code generation**: After building a request in the explorer, developers can generate client code in multiple languages showing how to make equivalent calls using SDKs. This bridges the gap between interactive learning and production implementation.

**Response inspection**: Detailed view of response structure including headers, body, metadata, token counts, and timing information. Developers can understand exactly what data the gateway returns and how to parse it in their applications.

### Software development kits

Client libraries abstract HTTP complexity and provide idiomatic interfaces for each programming language:

**Connection management**: SDKs handle connection pooling, keep-alive optimization, and graceful connection closure, removing the burden of low-level HTTP client configuration from developers.

**Authentication integration**: Built-in authentication support where developers configure credentials once during client initialization, and the SDK automatically includes proper authentication headers in all requests. This prevents common mistakes like hardcoding API keys or forgetting to include authorization.

**Type-safe interfaces**: SDKs provide strongly-typed request and response objects (in languages that support typing) so developers get compile-time verification of parameter correctness and IDE autocompletion. This reduces runtime errors from typos or incorrect parameter types.

**Streaming abstractions**: High-level APIs for consuming streaming responses using language-native patterns like iterators in Python, async streams in JavaScript, or channels in Go. Developers don't need to handle raw server-sent events parsing.

**Error handling utilities**: SDKs translate HTTP error responses into language-specific exception hierarchies with detailed error information. Built-in retry logic with exponential backoff handles transient failures automatically while remaining configurable for advanced users.

**Observability instrumentation**: SDKs automatically emit structured logs, metrics, and traces that integrate with popular observability platforms. Developers get visibility into API calls without manually instrumenting every request, improving overall system observability.

**Token counting helpers**: Utility functions that estimate token counts for prompts before sending requests, helping developers optimize costs and avoid context window overflows. These helpers use the same tokenization logic as the models, providing accurate estimates.

### Prompt engineering guidance

While SDK and documentation infrastructure is generic, this content is highly AI-specific:

**Prompt construction best practices**: Guidance on structuring prompts for clarity, providing appropriate context, separating instructions from data, and formatting for different model types. Examples show effective patterns for common tasks like summarization, extraction, classification, and generation.

**Model behavior documentation**: Detailed explanations of how different models respond to various prompt patterns, including quirks, strengths, and weaknesses. For instance, documentation might explain that certain models perform better with explicit step-by-step instructions while others excel at creative open-ended prompts.

**Template library**: Pre-built prompt templates for common use cases like customer support responses, code generation, data analysis, and content moderation. Templates include placeholders for dynamic content and annotations explaining design decisions. Developers can adapt templates rather than starting from scratch.

**Token optimization techniques**: Strategies for reducing token consumption without degrading quality, such as using abbreviations, removing redundant words, restructuring for conciseness, and leveraging prompt caching for repeated content. Cost examples quantify potential savings.

**Multi-turn conversation patterns**: Guidance on managing conversation state, pruning context history, and structuring system messages for chatbot applications. Examples show how to maintain coherent multi-turn dialogues without hitting context limits.

**Few-shot learning examples**: How to use example inputs and outputs to guide model behavior, including optimal number of examples, formatting conventions, and when few-shot learning is more effective than instruction-only prompts.

### Integration examples and tutorials

Practical guides demonstrate end-to-end implementation patterns:

**Getting started tutorials**: Step-by-step walkthroughs that take developers from zero to a working integration in minutes. Tutorials cover installation, authentication, making first requests, and handling responses. Each language SDK has dedicated tutorials using idiomatic patterns.

**Common use case examples**: Code examples for typical scenarios like building a chatbot, implementing semantic search, analyzing documents, generating content, or creating classification systems. Examples include error handling, logging, and production-ready patterns rather than toy demos.

**Advanced integration patterns**: Guidance on sophisticated implementations like implementing semantic caching, building RAG systems, orchestrating multi-model workflows, or optimizing batch processing. These examples address real production challenges teams encounter as they scale.

**Migration guides**: Documentation helping teams migrate from direct provider API calls to the gateway, including mapping of provider-specific parameters to gateway abstractions, credential migration, and testing strategies to verify equivalence.

**Testing and quality assurance**: Best practices for testing AI integrations, including techniques for asserting on non-deterministic outputs, building regression test suites for prompt changes, and measuring response quality over time.

### Cost transparency and estimation

Tools and documentation helping developers understand and predict costs:

**Token counting utilities**: SDKs include functions that estimate token counts for prompts using the same tokenization as models. Developers can check token counts before submission to predict costs and avoid exceeding limits.

**Cost calculators**: Interactive tools where developers input expected usage patterns (requests per day, average prompt length, model selection) and receive cost estimates. This helps budget planning and cost-benefit analysis of different approaches.

**Pricing documentation**: Clear explanation of cost models including per-token pricing for different models, any minimum charges, egress costs, and how costs accumulate across features like embeddings or fine-tuning. Examples show cost breakdowns for realistic scenarios.

**Usage monitoring guidance**: Documentation on accessing usage analytics, setting up cost alerts, and implementing application-level token budgets using SDK utilities. This helps teams maintain cost awareness as usage scales.

### Version management and updates

Strategies for handling API evolution while maintaining backward compatibility:

**API versioning scheme**: Clear explanation of version numbering, what constitutes breaking versus non-breaking changes, deprecation policies, and sunset timelines. Developers understand how to stay current without unexpected disruptions.

**Changelog and migration notes**: Detailed release notes for each API version explaining new features, parameter changes, and deprecated endpoints. Migration guides provide step-by-step instructions for updating code across versions.

**SDK version alignment**: SDK releases aligned with API versions, with clear compatibility matrices showing which SDK versions work with which API versions. Automated dependency management helps developers stay current.

**Deprecation warnings**: SDKs emit warnings when developers use deprecated parameters or endpoints, with links to migration documentation. This provides advance notice before breaking changes take effect.

## Solution checklist links

Implementation guidance for documentation and SDK provisioning:

- **Documentation platform selection**: Choose documentation infrastructure (dedicated solutions like ReadMe or Stoplight, static site generators like Docusaurus or MkDocs, API-first platforms like Swagger/OpenAPI)
- **OpenAPI specification**: Create comprehensive OpenAPI/Swagger specifications as the source of truth for API documentation, enabling automatic SDK generation and interactive explorers
- **SDK generation strategy**: Decide between hand-crafted SDKs for maximum quality versus auto-generated SDKs for broader language coverage, or hybrid approaches
- **Interactive playground implementation**: Deploy API explorer infrastructure allowing live request execution with authentication, rate limiting, and cost controls
- **Prompt template library creation**: Develop and curate prompt templates covering organizational use cases, with versioning and community contribution workflows
- **Example repository setup**: Create well-documented code examples for each supported language and common integration patterns, kept current with API changes
- **Documentation CI/CD**: Implement automated documentation testing, link checking, code example verification, and deployment pipelines
- **Developer feedback loops**: Establish channels for developers to report documentation issues, request clarification, and contribute improvements
- **Analytics instrumentation**: Track which documentation pages are most viewed, where users get stuck, and which examples are most copied to prioritize improvements
- **Content maintenance schedule**: Define ownership and update cadence for different documentation categories to prevent staleness

(Note: Detailed implementation checklists will be created in the `/igtai/checklists/` directory as this pattern matures)

## Contraindications

Documentation and SDK investment may not be appropriate in certain scenarios:

**Internal-only tools with limited audience**: If the AI gateway serves only a small internal team of experienced developers who work closely with the gateway team, comprehensive public documentation and multi-language SDKs may be over-investment. Lightweight internal docs and language-specific SDKs for the actual technology stack may suffice.

**Rapidly changing experimental systems**: During early prototypal phases when APIs change daily and features are unstable, maintaining detailed documentation creates overhead that slows iteration. Minimal inline code comments and direct collaboration may be more effective until interfaces stabilize.

**Resource-constrained environments**: Organizations with limited technical writing, developer relations, and SDK engineering resources may need to prioritize gateway functionality over documentation quality initially. However, this creates technical debt that hinders adoption and should be addressed as resources permit.

**Highly specialized use cases**: If the gateway serves a single application with very specific requirements and no plans for broader adoption, the team developing that application may prefer direct communication with gateway developers over formal documentation. The cost of documentation might exceed its value.

**Third-party gateway adoption**: When using commercial AI gateway platforms that provide their own documentation and SDKs, creating redundant organizational documentation may not add value unless significant customization or policy guidance is needed beyond vendor materials.

**Compliance or security restrictions**: In highly regulated environments where documentation cannot be made public and internal documentation systems are restricted, the effort to maintain formal docs within constraints may be prohibitive. Direct knowledge transfer and code-level documentation might be more practical.

Despite these exceptions, most AI gateway deployments benefit substantially from investment in documentation and SDKs. Poor developer experience leads to fragmented implementations, inefficient usage patterns, and difficulty scaling adoption across the organization. The contraindications above represent edge cases rather than common scenarios.
