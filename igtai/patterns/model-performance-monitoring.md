# Model performance monitoring

## The problem

AI model quality is inherently non-deterministic and can degrade over time in ways that traditional API monitoring cannot detect. While conventional API observability tracks request counts, latency percentiles, and HTTP status codes, these metrics fail to capture the unique challenges of AI systems: models may respond quickly with plausible but incorrect information, different providers may have vastly different reliability and quality characteristics, and response quality can drift gradually as models are updated or as usage patterns evolve.

Organizations consuming AI APIs face several monitoring blind spots. A model might maintain 99.9% uptime and sub-second response times while producing increasingly poor quality outputs. Provider outages may affect only certain model versions or regions, requiring granular tracking beyond simple availability checks. User satisfaction with AI responses often correlates poorly with technical metrics like latency, making it difficult to identify when models underperform from an end-user perspective.

Without AI-specific monitoring, organizations lack visibility into critical questions: Which models are consistently reliable? When does response quality degrade? Are certain providers experiencing issues? How do users perceive AI-generated content? Is the system hallucinating more frequently over time? These gaps leave teams reacting to user complaints rather than proactively identifying and addressing quality issues.

## Forces

Several competing concerns make effective AI performance monitoring challenging:

- **Non-deterministic outputs**: Unlike traditional APIs that return predictable data structures, AI models generate different responses to identical inputs. Monitoring must account for legitimate variance while detecting problematic deviations.

- **Quality vs. latency trade-offs**: Fast responses may sacrifice quality, while high-quality responses may be slower. Monitoring must capture both dimensions and their relationship without conflating speed with success.

- **Multi-dimensional quality signals**: Model performance encompasses accuracy, relevance, coherence, safety, and user satisfaction. No single metric captures overall quality, requiring composite monitoring approaches.

- **Provider heterogeneity**: Different AI providers have distinct reliability profiles, pricing structures, latency characteristics, and quality levels. Monitoring must enable meaningful cross-provider comparison.

- **Temporal drift detection**: Model behavior changes gradually over time as providers update models, training data shifts, or usage patterns evolve. Detecting drift requires longitudinal analysis beyond point-in-time metrics.

- **Privacy vs. observability tension**: Capturing prompts and responses for quality analysis conflicts with data privacy requirements. Monitoring must balance insight needs with compliance constraints.

- **User perception variability**: Different users may perceive identical responses as high or low quality depending on context, expertise, and expectations. Objective quality metrics may not align with subjective satisfaction.

- **Alert noise management**: Setting thresholds for non-deterministic systems risks excessive false positives from normal variance or false negatives that miss genuine degradation.

## Risk the pattern mitigates

This pattern primarily addresses three risks from the IGT-AI model:

**[Poor observability](../risks.md#poor-observability)** from operational and performance risks: Without proper logging, monitoring, and tracing of AI API calls, it becomes challenging to diagnose issues and understand usage patterns. Model performance monitoring provides visibility into AI-specific quality indicators that traditional observability tools miss.

**[Hallucination](../risks.md#hallucination)** from content risks: AI models may generate incorrect or fabricated information that misleads users or results in poor decision-making. Quality drift detection and consistency checking help identify when models produce unreliable outputs with increasing frequency.

**[High application latency](../risks.md#high-application-latency)** from operational and performance risks: AI APIs can introduce latency into applications, especially if providers experience high demand or outages. Monitoring response time percentiles by model and provider enables teams to identify performance bottlenecks and route traffic to faster alternatives.

## How it works

Model performance monitoring extends traditional API observability with AI-specific quality indicators, drift detection mechanisms, and user satisfaction signals. The implementation requires several key components that work together to provide comprehensive visibility into AI system health.

### Response time monitoring by model and provider

The gateway tracks detailed latency metrics segmented by model, provider, version, and request characteristics. Unlike generic API latency monitoring that reports overall averages, AI monitoring captures:

- **Percentile distributions**: p50, p95, p99 latencies reveal how consistently models perform rather than masking outliers behind averages
- **Provider comparison**: Side-by-side latency tracking for equivalent models across providers (GPT-4 via OpenAI vs. Azure vs. third-party providers)
- **Time-to-first-token**: For streaming responses, tracks how quickly users see initial output, which dominates perceived latency
- **Model version correlation**: Identifies if new model versions introduce latency regressions
- **Request size impact**: Analyzes how input token counts affect response times
- **Geographic latency**: Tracks performance by region to identify infrastructure issues

This granular latency data enables teams to route traffic to consistently fast models, detect provider-specific performance degradation, and set SLAs based on model capabilities rather than unrealistic universal targets.

### Error rate tracking and classification

Beyond HTTP status codes, the gateway categorizes errors by AI-specific failure modes:

- **Provider outages**: Complete unavailability of a specific model or provider
- **Rate limit errors**: Quota exhaustion or throttling at the provider level
- **Context overflow**: Requests exceeding model token limits
- **Content policy violations**: Requests or responses blocked by provider safety filters
- **Timeout failures**: Requests abandoned due to excessive processing time
- **Invalid response formats**: Models returning malformed JSON or violating expected schemas
- **Model deprecation warnings**: Notifications when using sunset model versions

Error tracking is segmented by model, provider, tenant, application, and time period. This enables pattern detection such as "GPT-4 via Azure had 3x higher timeout rates on November 15th" or "Provider X rejects 5% of requests for content policy violations while Provider Y rejects 0.1%".

### Quality drift detection through embedding analysis

Model response quality can degrade gradually without triggering explicit errors or latency increases. Quality drift detection uses embedding similarity analysis to identify behavioral changes over time:

1. **Baseline establishment**: During normal operation, the system generates embeddings for representative prompts and their corresponding responses, creating a quality baseline
2. **Ongoing comparison**: New responses to similar prompts are embedded and compared to baseline embeddings using cosine similarity or other distance metrics
3. **Drift scoring**: Significant deviations from baseline similarity scores indicate potential quality drift
4. **Temporal trending**: Tracks drift scores over time to identify gradual degradation vs. sudden shifts

For example, if a customer support model historically responds to "How do I reset my password?" with detailed step-by-step instructions (baseline embedding), but recent responses become increasingly vague or off-topic, the similarity score drops, triggering drift alerts.

This approach complements consistency checking, where the same prompt is sent to a model multiple times to verify response stability. High variance in responses to identical prompts indicates potential quality issues.

### User satisfaction signals

Technical metrics alone cannot capture whether AI responses meet user needs. The gateway integrates explicit and implicit satisfaction signals:

**Explicit feedback mechanisms**:
- **Thumbs up/down ratings**: Simple binary feedback on response quality
- **Detailed feedback forms**: Structured input on accuracy, helpfulness, tone, and relevance
- **Correction submissions**: Users providing improved responses when model output is inadequate
- **Escalation tracking**: When users abandon AI interactions and request human support

**Implicit behavioral signals**:
- **Conversation abandonment rates**: Users ending sessions after AI responses, suggesting dissatisfaction
- **Follow-up question patterns**: Repeated rephrasing of queries indicates unclear or inadequate initial responses
- **Copy/paste rates**: Tracking whether users utilize AI-generated content or ignore it
- **Session duration**: Unusually short or long sessions correlating with response quality

The gateway correlates satisfaction signals with specific models, prompts, response characteristics, and temporal patterns. This reveals which models users trust, which prompt patterns generate poor responses, and whether recent model updates improved or degraded user experience.

### Composite quality metrics and dashboards

Individual monitoring dimensions combine into comprehensive quality views:

- **Model reliability scores**: Composite metrics combining uptime, error rates, latency consistency, and user satisfaction for each model
- **Provider comparison dashboards**: Side-by-side visualization of equivalent models across providers to inform routing and failover decisions
- **Quality trend charts**: Longitudinal views showing how model performance evolves over weeks and months
- **Anomaly detection alerts**: Automated identification of sudden changes in error rates, latency, drift scores, or satisfaction signals
- **Cost-quality trade-off analysis**: Correlating model performance with token consumption to identify optimal cost-quality balance

### Integration with model routing and failover

Performance monitoring directly informs operational decisions. When monitoring detects degradation:

- **Automatic traffic shifting**: Route requests away from underperforming models to higher-quality alternatives
- **Circuit breaker activation**: Temporarily disable models experiencing high error rates or severe latency spikes
- **Canary rollout management**: Gradually increase traffic to new model versions while monitoring quality metrics
- **A/B testing support**: Compare response quality across models under production load to inform selection decisions

This closes the loop from observation to action, enabling self-healing AI systems that respond to quality issues without manual intervention.

## Contraindications

Model performance monitoring is not appropriate when:

- **Basic uptime monitoring is sufficient**: For non-critical AI features where simple availability checks meet monitoring needs without justifying the complexity of quality tracking.

- **Single model, single provider**: Systems using only one model from one provider have limited comparative value from cross-model performance analysis, though drift detection may still be valuable.

- **Complete privacy restrictions**: When regulatory or policy constraints prohibit any logging of prompts, responses, or derived metrics, making quality monitoring technically infeasible.

- **Fully deterministic requirements**: Applications that cannot tolerate any response variation may be inappropriate for AI altogether, rendering non-deterministic monitoring moot.

- **Extremely low traffic volumes**: Systems with too few requests to establish statistical baselines or detect meaningful patterns, where monitoring overhead exceeds benefit.

- **Prototype or experimental systems**: Early-stage projects where rapid iteration matters more than production monitoring rigor, though establishing monitoring early can prevent technical debt.
