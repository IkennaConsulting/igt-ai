# Audit trails and compliance logging

## The problem

Organizations deploying AI systems face increasing pressure to demonstrate responsible AI use, prove policy enforcement, and maintain accountability for AI-driven decisions. When an AI system produces an unexpected outcome—a harmful response, a compliance violation, or a cost spike—the first questions are always the same: Who triggered this? What prompt was used? Which model processed it? What policies were applied? When did it happen?

Without comprehensive logging, these questions have no answers. Applications call AI APIs directly, each implementing its own logging approach—or none at all. Some teams log prompts but not responses. Others capture responses but strip user context. Most exclude policy decisions entirely. When incidents occur, investigators face fractured audit trails scattered across application logs, provider dashboards, and team spreadsheets. Reconstructing what happened becomes forensic archaeology, and proving compliance during audits requires manual evidence gathering across disconnected systems.

The stakes extend beyond incident response. Regulatory frameworks like GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2, and emerging AI-specific regulations demand demonstrable governance: Who accessed which AI capabilities? What data was processed? Were policies enforced? Can you prove it? Organizations without comprehensive audit trails cannot answer these questions with confidence, exposing themselves to regulatory penalties, failed audits, and reputational damage.

The challenge is uniquely difficult for AI systems. Traditional application logging captures deterministic operations—database queries, API calls with predictable inputs and outputs. AI logging must capture non-deterministic natural language interactions while respecting privacy constraints. Prompts may contain sensitive data that cannot be stored verbatim. Responses may include PII generated by the model. Token consumption must be tracked for cost attribution. Policy decisions must be logged to prove enforcement. All of this must happen at scale, with immutable storage, retention policies that balance compliance with privacy, and queryability for investigations.

## Forces

Several competing concerns make comprehensive audit logging challenging:

**Privacy versus observability tension**: Effective debugging requires logging full prompts and responses to understand model behavior and reproduce issues. But these prompts often contain sensitive data—customer information, proprietary business context, or personal details. Compliance frameworks like GDPR mandate data minimization, while operational needs demand comprehensive visibility. Organizations must capture enough detail for accountability without creating privacy liabilities.

**Storage costs versus retention requirements**: AI interactions generate massive log volumes. A single conversation thread might include dozens of prompts and multi-thousand-token responses. At scale, storing every interaction verbatim becomes prohibitively expensive. But compliance frameworks mandate multi-year retention for certain data types. Organizations must balance storage costs against legal obligations, implementing intelligent retention policies that preserve critical evidence while purging ephemeral data.

**Immutability needs versus operational flexibility**: Audit trails must be tamper-proof to serve as reliable evidence during investigations and compliance audits. Once written, logs cannot be modified or deleted without leaving a trace. But operational realities demand flexibility—purging data after retention periods expire, redacting accidentally logged secrets, or correcting misclassified sensitive data. The logging system must provide immutability for integrity while supporting controlled, auditable modifications for legitimate operational needs.

**Real-time queryability versus append-only performance**: Investigators need to query logs interactively—find all prompts from a specific user, identify when a policy blocked a request, trace a conversation thread across multiple sessions. Query performance requires indexed, structured storage. But high-throughput AI workloads demand append-only logging with minimal latency overhead. The architecture must support both fast writes and flexible queries without compromising either.

**Granularity versus noise**: Comprehensive logging means capturing every decision point—when a prompt was received, what security checks applied, which model was selected, whether caching occurred, what policies triggered, whether redaction happened, and what response was returned. This granularity enables deep investigation but creates overwhelming log volumes that obscure critical signals. Balancing signal and noise requires thoughtful design of what to log at which levels.

**Compliance regulations across jurisdictions**: Different regulatory frameworks impose conflicting requirements. GDPR mandates data minimization and grants deletion rights, while financial regulations require comprehensive retention and immutability. Healthcare regulations prohibit certain types of logging, while government contracts demand complete audit trails. Organizations operating across jurisdictions must navigate overlapping and contradictory obligations in a single logging architecture.

**Multi-tenancy and data isolation**: In shared AI infrastructure, different tenants have different compliance requirements and privacy expectations. Enterprise customers may demand that their logs remain isolated from other tenants and never leave specific geographic regions. Audit systems must enforce tenant boundaries while enabling centralized administration and cross-tenant analytics for platform operators.

## Risk the pattern mitigates

This pattern addresses two critical risks from the IGT-AI risk model:

### Fractured audit trails

**[Fractured audit trails](../risks.md#fractured-audit-trails)** occur when configuration changes, policy decisions, and system events are logged inconsistently or not at all, making it unclear who made what changes, when, and why. This creates accountability gaps and troubleshooting challenges.

In AI systems, fractured audit trails manifest as:

- **Unattributed policy changes**: When content moderation thresholds are adjusted or budget limits are modified, there's no record of which administrator made the change or why, leading to finger-pointing during incident reviews.
- **Missing policy enforcement evidence**: During compliance audits, organizations cannot prove that PII redaction policies were actually enforced on specific requests, only that the policies exist in configuration.
- **Incomplete incident timelines**: When investigating a security incident involving AI misuse, logs only capture some requests but miss critical context like which user credentials were used or what system prompts were active.
- **Lost cost attribution**: When unexpected charges appear, there's no way to trace which team, application, or user drove the consumption because request logs don't capture organizational context.

Centralized audit logging creates a single, comprehensive record of all AI governance events, enabling accountability and supporting investigations.

### Poor observability

**[Poor observability](../risks.md#poor-observability)** means that without proper logging, monitoring, and tracing of AI API calls, it becomes challenging to diagnose issues and understand usage patterns.

For AI systems, poor observability creates:

- **Inability to reproduce issues**: A user reports an inappropriate AI response, but without the exact prompt, system context, model version, and parameters, developers cannot reproduce the behavior to diagnose and fix it.
- **Hidden performance degradation**: Model response quality declines over time due to provider changes or data drift, but without systematic logging of responses and quality metrics, the degradation goes unnoticed until users complain.
- **Cost optimization blindness**: Organizations cannot identify which prompts are most expensive, which users drive costs, or where semantic caching could provide savings because token usage isn't correlated with request metadata.
- **Security blind spots**: Attempted prompt injection attacks or policy violations go undetected because there's no centralized logging of security events and anomalous request patterns.

Comprehensive logging provides the visibility needed to monitor AI systems effectively, diagnose issues rapidly, and optimize operations.

## How it works

Audit trails and compliance logging establishes the AI gateway as a comprehensive logging point that captures all AI interactions, policy decisions, and governance events in a centralized, immutable, privacy-aware audit system.

### Comprehensive event capture

The gateway logs multiple categories of events, each serving distinct audit and observability purposes:

**Request and response logging**: Every AI interaction is captured with full context:
- **Request metadata**: Timestamp, requesting application, user identity, team/organization affiliation, request ID for correlation
- **Prompt content**: The actual prompt text sent to the model (subject to privacy redaction, described below)
- **System context**: System prompts, conversation history, temperature and sampling parameters, model selection
- **Response content**: Model output, token counts (input and output), latency metrics, model version used
- **Caching status**: Whether the response was served from cache, cache key, cache hit/miss ratio

This enables replay capabilities where historical prompts can be resubmitted to current models to compare behavior, diagnose regressions, or test improvements.

**Policy enforcement logging**: Every policy evaluation is recorded:
- **PII detection events**: When PII is detected in prompts or responses, the log captures what was found (entity types, not values), whether it was redacted, and which detection rules triggered
- **Content moderation decisions**: When content filters block or flag requests for toxicity, inappropriate content, or brand violations, the decision and reasoning are logged
- **Budget enforcement actions**: When rate limiting or token budget controls throttle or reject requests, the policy trigger and available quota are recorded
- **Compliance controls**: When data residency rules route requests to specific regions or when training opt-out flags are applied, these governance actions are logged

This creates an auditable record proving that policies were actively enforced, not just configured.

**Administrative actions**: All configuration changes are logged with full context:
- **Who**: Administrator identity, authentication method, source IP address
- **What**: Configuration change details—policy modifications, model routing updates, budget adjustments
- **When**: Timestamp with timezone and correlation to system changes
- **Why**: Change justification captured through required change descriptions or ticket references

This provides accountability for governance changes and supports incident investigations.

**Model selection and routing**: Routing decisions are captured to explain model choices:
- **Selection criteria**: Why a specific model was chosen—cost optimization, capability matching, failover, canary rollout
- **Alternatives considered**: Which other models were candidates and why they weren't selected
- **Performance metrics**: Latency, availability, and cost for the selected model

This transparency helps debug unexpected model behavior and optimize routing rules.

### Privacy-aware redaction

Logging comprehensive prompts and responses creates privacy risks when they contain sensitive data. The gateway applies intelligent redaction before storage:

**Automatic PII detection and replacement**: Before writing prompts to logs, the gateway scans for personally identifiable information using the same detection mechanisms used for input filtering. Detected PII entities are replaced with type placeholders:

```
Original prompt: "What healthcare options are available for John Smith, SSN 123-45-6789?"
Logged prompt: "What healthcare options are available for [PERSON_NAME], SSN [SSN]?"
```

This preserves the semantic structure and intent of prompts for debugging while removing identifying details. Organizations can tune redaction aggressiveness—some implementations hash PII values to enable correlation without reversibility, while others replace all instances with generic tokens.

**Selective logging levels**: Different request types have different logging needs:
- **Full logging**: For internal applications with low privacy sensitivity, prompts and responses are logged verbatim for maximum debuggability
- **Metadata-only logging**: For high-privacy scenarios, only request metadata (user, timestamp, model, token count) is captured without prompt or response content
- **Redacted logging**: The default mode where prompts and responses are logged with PII redaction applied

Applications can specify logging level preferences through gateway headers or policy configuration.

**Secure storage with access controls**: Logged data is stored in encrypted backends with role-based access controls. Only authorized personnel (security teams, compliance officers, designated administrators) can access full audit logs. Most users see only aggregated metrics and anonymized summaries. Access to raw logs generates secondary audit events, creating a chain of accountability for sensitive data access.

### Immutable log storage

Audit trails must be tamper-proof to serve as reliable evidence. The gateway implements several mechanisms:

**Append-only data structures**: Logs are written to append-only storage systems that prohibit modification or deletion of existing records. Technologies like immutable object storage (AWS S3 with object lock, Azure immutable blob storage), blockchain-based audit logs, or write-once databases ensure that once written, log entries cannot be altered.

**Cryptographic integrity**: Each log entry includes a cryptographic hash of its content and the hash of the previous entry, creating a chain where tampering with any entry breaks the chain and becomes detectable. This provides mathematical proof of integrity without requiring blockchain infrastructure.

**Write-ahead logging**: High-throughput AI workloads demand fast logging with minimal latency impact. The gateway uses write-ahead logging where log entries are buffered in memory and flushed asynchronously to permanent storage. This decouples logging latency from request processing while ensuring no logs are lost.

### Retention policies and automatic purging

Balancing compliance requirements with storage costs and privacy obligations requires intelligent retention:

**Policy-driven retention periods**: Organizations define retention policies based on data classification:
- **Compliance-regulated data**: Healthcare-related prompts might require 7-year retention for HIPAA compliance
- **Security-relevant events**: Policy violations and security incidents might require 5-year retention for legal holds
- **Operational logs**: Standard AI requests might have 90-day retention for debugging and optimization
- **High-privacy data**: Prompts containing financial information might have 30-day retention unless flagged for investigation

The gateway automatically applies retention policies based on request classification, data sensitivity detected through PII scanning, and organizational policies.

**Automatic purging with audit trail**: When retention periods expire, the gateway automatically deletes log entries. But the deletion itself is logged—audit records show that data was purged, when, why (retention policy expiration), and by which automated process. This proves compliance with data minimization requirements while maintaining accountability.

**Legal hold support**: When litigation, audits, or investigations require preserving data beyond normal retention periods, administrators can place legal holds on specific logs. Held data is exempt from automatic purging until the hold is released, and all hold placements and removals are themselves logged for auditability.

### Queryability and investigation support

Audit logs must support investigations, which require flexible querying:

**Structured logging with rich metadata**: Logs are stored in structured formats (JSON, Parquet, or columnar databases) with indexed fields for common query patterns:
- Find all requests from a specific user
- Identify when a policy was triggered
- Trace conversation threads across multiple requests
- Aggregate token usage by team or application
- Detect anomalous request patterns

**Correlation IDs and threading**: Each request receives a unique correlation ID that links related events—the initial request, policy evaluations, cache checks, model calls, and responses. Conversation threads receive session IDs that group multi-turn interactions. This enables investigators to trace complete interaction flows.

**Time-series analytics**: AI usage patterns evolve over time. The logging system supports time-series queries to detect trends—increasing toxicity detection rates, changing token consumption patterns, or degrading model performance. Dashboards visualize these trends for proactive monitoring.

**Compliance reporting**: Automated reports aggregate audit data to demonstrate compliance:
- "All requests containing healthcare data were processed using HIPAA-compliant models"
- "PII redaction was applied to 847 requests in the past month"
- "No administrator made configuration changes outside approved change windows"

These reports provide evidence for auditors without requiring manual log review.

### Integration with broader observability stacks

Audit logging complements existing monitoring infrastructure:

**OpenTelemetry integration**: The gateway emits logs, metrics, and traces using OpenTelemetry standards, enabling integration with enterprise observability platforms like Datadog, New Relic, Splunk, or Elastic. AI-specific metrics (token usage, policy enforcement rates, model latencies) flow into existing dashboards alongside traditional application metrics.

**SIEM integration**: Security Information and Event Management systems ingest audit logs for correlation with other security events. When a user account shows suspicious behavior across multiple systems, the SIEM can correlate AI API usage patterns with login anomalies or data access events to detect sophisticated attacks.

**Cost management integration**: Token usage logs feed into financial systems for chargeback, budget forecasting, and cost optimization. Finance teams can attribute AI costs to specific departments, projects, or cost centers based on comprehensive usage data.

### Why this is AI-specific

While audit logging exists for all systems, AI logging has unique requirements that traditional application logging doesn't address:

**Prompts and responses are unstructured natural language**: Traditional APIs log structured requests (SQL queries, REST endpoints with JSON payloads) where sensitive data appears in predictable fields. AI prompts are freeform text where PII can appear anywhere in unpredictable formats. Detecting and redacting it requires natural language processing, not schema-based filtering.

**Token-based pricing creates cost attribution needs**: Traditional APIs charge per request or by compute time. AI charges by token count, which varies wildly—a simple question might cost fractions of a cent while a complex conversation costs dollars. Audit logs must capture token usage for accurate cost attribution and optimization.

**Non-deterministic outputs require replay capabilities**: When a traditional API produces unexpected output, developers can replay the exact request to reproduce the issue. AI models are non-deterministic—the same prompt can produce different responses. Effective debugging requires logging full prompts, system context, model version, and parameters so investigators can replay historical interactions and compare current behavior.

**Model performance tracking**: Traditional APIs have predictable behavior. AI model quality can drift over time as providers update models or as usage patterns shift. Audit logs must enable quality monitoring by capturing responses, enabling embedding-based similarity analysis to detect drift, and supporting automated quality regression detection.

**Compliance demonstrations for AI governance**: Emerging AI regulations require proving that governance controls are actively enforced, not just configured. Organizations must demonstrate that PII redaction happened, that data residency rules were respected, that training opt-out was enforced. This requires granular policy enforcement logging that traditional systems don't provide.

## Contraindications

Comprehensive audit logging introduces storage costs, latency overhead, and privacy risks that may not be justified in certain contexts:

**Early prototypes and low-stakes experiments**: For initial AI experiments with a single developer and no sensitive data, the overhead of configuring immutable audit logging may exceed the risk. Teams building proofs-of-concept can defer comprehensive logging until the project approaches production, accepting temporary observability gaps in exchange for faster iteration.

**Extremely high-throughput, cost-sensitive workloads**: Applications processing millions of AI requests per hour may find that logging costs approach or exceed AI API costs themselves. For instance, logging 1KB of metadata per request at 10,000 requests/second generates 864 GB per day. If storage and ingestion costs exceed the value of the logged data, organizations may choose sampled logging (logging 1% of requests) or metadata-only logging that excludes prompts and responses.

**Privacy regulations that prohibit logging**: Some jurisdictions or contractual agreements prohibit logging certain types of data under any circumstances, even with redaction. For example, healthcare regulations may forbid storing even redacted patient interactions in certain contexts, or government security classifications may prohibit logging prompts containing classified information regardless of controls. In these scenarios, metadata-only logging or no logging may be the only compliant approach.

**Real-time streaming with sub-10ms latency requirements**: Append-only logging typically adds 1-5ms latency to requests. For ultra-low-latency applications where every millisecond matters (such as real-time bidding or high-frequency trading augmented by AI), logging overhead may be unacceptable. These applications might use asynchronous background logging with eventual consistency, accepting potential log loss during failures.

**Offline or edge deployments**: AI systems running on edge devices, mobile applications, or intermittent connectivity environments cannot rely on real-time logging to centralized systems. These deployments may require local buffering with eventual log upload when connectivity is available, accepting gaps in audit trails during network partitions.

**Open-source or community projects**: Projects without organizational backing, compliance requirements, or dedicated infrastructure may find comprehensive audit logging impractical. Individual developers or small teams may rely on simpler alternatives like basic request logging to local files or optional cloud logging for users who opt in.

Despite these contraindications, most enterprise AI deployments benefit from comprehensive audit logging. Organizations subject to regulatory compliance, handling sensitive data, or operating at scale should treat audit trails as mandatory infrastructure.
