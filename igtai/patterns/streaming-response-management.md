# Streaming response management

## The problem

AI models generate responses token-by-token, producing output incrementally rather than returning complete responses in a single payload. Traditional HTTP request-response patterns assume APIs return complete data after processing, but this approach creates unacceptable user experience for AI applications where generating a comprehensive response can take tens of seconds or even minutes. Users waiting for a complete response see nothing during generation, experiencing what appears to be a frozen or unresponsive application.

Without streaming support, applications must choose between two poor alternatives: either implement long timeout values that keep users staring at loading spinners for extended periods, or artificially limit response lengths to reduce generation time, sacrificing quality for perceived responsiveness. Neither approach provides the real-time feedback users expect from modern interactive AI applications.

Furthermore, traditional API gateways are optimized for discrete request-response cycles with fixed timeouts and connection pooling assumptions that break when applied to long-lived streaming connections. Standard gateway features like buffering, response transformation, and timeout management require fundamental rethinking for token streams that may continue for minutes rather than milliseconds.

## Forces

Several competing concerns make streaming response management challenging:

- **Progressive display requirements**: Users expect to see responses appear word-by-word as they are generated, providing immediate feedback that the system is working and allowing them to begin reading before generation completes. This expectation comes from experiences with consumer AI products like ChatGPT and Claude, where streaming has become the standard interaction model.

- **Connection lifecycle complexity**: Streaming responses require long-lived HTTP connections that remain open for extended periods. Gateways must manage these connections differently from standard request-response patterns, handling network interruptions, client disconnections, and connection timeouts without dropping in-progress responses.

- **Timeout management ambiguity**: Traditional API timeout policies measure time-to-first-byte or total request duration, but streaming responses complicate these metrics. A healthy streaming response generates the first token within seconds but may continue generating for minutes. Gateway timeouts must distinguish between stalled streams (no new tokens) and active long-duration responses.

- **Buffer management challenges**: Gateways that buffer responses for transformation or inspection can inadvertently destroy streaming benefits by holding tokens until large chunks accumulate. Effective streaming requires forwarding tokens immediately while maintaining the ability to inspect and transform content when necessary.

- **Error handling mid-stream**: Errors can occur after streaming has begun and tokens have already been sent to clients. Unlike traditional APIs where errors prevent any response from reaching the client, streaming errors must be communicated within the stream itself, requiring special handling and client-side error detection logic.

- **Backpressure and flow control**: Clients may consume tokens slower than models generate them, requiring buffering or flow control. Conversely, network congestion can cause tokens to queue, increasing perceived latency. Gateways must balance between these concerns without losing the real-time nature of streaming.

- **Transform and filter complexity**: Content moderation, PII redaction, and response transformation that operate on complete responses must be adapted for streaming contexts where content arrives incrementally. Some operations (like counting output tokens for billing) cannot complete until the stream ends.

## Risk the pattern mitigates

This pattern primarily mitigates **[High application latency](../risks.md#high-application-latency)** from the IGT-AI technical quality risks category. While streaming does not reduce the total time required to generate a complete response, it dramatically improves **perceived latency** by providing immediate user feedback and progressive display.

Users experience streaming responses as significantly more responsive than buffered responses of identical total duration. Streaming transforms a 30-second wait with no feedback into an engaging experience where content appears within 1-2 seconds and continues flowing. This psychological difference is critical for user satisfaction and application engagement.

Additionally, streaming enables users to **interrupt or cancel requests early** if they see the response is not meeting their needs, saving both token costs and user time. Without streaming, users must wait for complete responses before evaluating whether to refine their prompts, leading to wasted API calls and frustration.

## How it works

Streaming response management adapts traditional gateway capabilities to handle token-by-token delivery of AI model outputs. The implementation requires specialized handling at multiple layers:

### Server-sent events (SSE) protocol

Most AI providers deliver streaming responses using the Server-Sent Events protocol, a standard HTTP-based mechanism for server-to-client streaming. The gateway establishes SSE connections with providers and manages the stream lifecycle:

- **Connection establishment**: When a client requests streaming (typically via an API parameter like `stream: true`), the gateway establishes an SSE connection to the AI provider and sets appropriate headers (`Content-Type: text/event-stream`, `Cache-Control: no-cache`) to maintain the streaming connection.

- **Event parsing and forwarding**: The gateway parses incoming SSE events from the provider, which typically arrive in a structured format containing token chunks, metadata, and completion signals. These events are forwarded to the client, optionally transformed or enriched with additional information.

- **Connection lifecycle management**: The gateway maintains connection health checks, detects when streams complete successfully or encounter errors, and handles cleanup when clients disconnect mid-stream.

### Chunked response processing

Tokens arrive in small chunks that must be processed and forwarded with minimal latency:

- **Immediate forwarding**: The gateway forwards token chunks to clients as soon as they arrive from the provider, avoiding buffering that would increase latency. This requires disabling response buffering that many gateways apply by default for standard HTTP responses.

- **Incremental transformation**: When content filtering or PII redaction is required, the gateway applies transformations to token chunks as they arrive rather than waiting for complete responses. This may involve buffering small sliding windows of tokens to handle multi-token patterns while maintaining overall streaming performance.

- **Metadata injection**: The gateway can inject additional information into the stream, such as token usage estimates, model identifiers, or compliance tags, without disrupting the token flow. This metadata typically appears in separate SSE events or as structured data within the stream format.

### Streaming-specific timeout policies

Traditional timeout mechanisms must be adapted for streaming contexts:

- **Time-to-first-token timeout**: The gateway enforces a short timeout (typically 5-30 seconds) for receiving the first token from the AI provider. If no token arrives within this window, the request is considered failed and may trigger failover to alternative models or providers.

- **Inter-token timeout**: Once streaming begins, the gateway monitors time between tokens. If token flow stalls for longer than a configured threshold (typically 10-60 seconds), the connection is considered stalled and terminated. This prevents indefinitely hanging connections while allowing for natural pauses in token generation.

- **Maximum stream duration**: The gateway can enforce absolute limits on total stream duration to prevent runaway generation or resource exhaustion, even when tokens continue arriving normally. This provides a safety net against unexpectedly long responses.

### Buffer and transform strategies

Gateways balance immediate forwarding with the need for content inspection and transformation:

- **Streaming passthrough mode**: For use cases prioritizing latency, the gateway forwards tokens with no buffering or transformation, acting purely as a streaming proxy. This provides minimal latency overhead while maintaining centralized routing and authentication.

- **Line-buffered streaming**: The gateway buffers tokens until complete sentences or paragraphs form, then applies transformations and forwards the chunk. This enables more effective content filtering while maintaining near-real-time user experience.

- **Dual-pass streaming**: For comprehensive logging and analysis, the gateway streams tokens immediately to the client while simultaneously capturing a complete copy for post-processing. This preserves streaming benefits while enabling full response inspection for compliance, debugging, and analytics.

### Error handling within streams

Streaming responses require specialized error handling because partial content has already reached the client:

- **In-stream error signals**: When errors occur mid-stream, the gateway sends error events within the SSE stream using standardized formats that clients can detect and handle. For example, a content moderation violation detected after 100 tokens have streamed triggers an error event that the client displays appropriately.

- **Graceful degradation**: The gateway attempts to complete streaming responses even when encountering non-critical errors, such as logging failures or analytics collection issues. Only errors that compromise response integrity or violate policies trigger stream termination.

- **Retry and failover limitations**: Unlike discrete requests that can be transparently retried, streaming responses that have begun cannot be retried without client awareness. The gateway must decide failover strategies before streaming begins, based on time-to-first-token rather than mid-stream failures.

### Token counting and billing

Accurate cost tracking requires counting all tokens in streaming responses:

- **Incremental token counting**: The gateway maintains running token counts as chunks arrive, updating usage metrics in real-time rather than waiting for stream completion.

- **Stream completion confirmation**: Only when streams complete successfully does the gateway finalize token counts and commit billing records. Interrupted streams are tracked separately to distinguish between complete and partial responses.

- **Provider token reconciliation**: After stream completion, the gateway reconciles its counted tokens with provider-reported usage (typically included in final SSE events or response headers) to ensure billing accuracy.

### Client disconnection handling

Users may close browser tabs, navigate away, or experience network failures during streaming:

- **Disconnection detection**: The gateway monitors client connection health and detects when clients disconnect, preventing wasted token generation to clients that will never receive the tokens.

- **Provider stream cancellation**: When clients disconnect, the gateway terminates the upstream provider connection to stop token generation and avoid unnecessary costs. This requires careful handling to ensure billing records reflect only tokens generated before cancellation.

- **Reconnection support**: Advanced implementations may support resumable streams where clients can reconnect and continue receiving a partially delivered response, though this requires state management and is not commonly implemented.

## Contraindications

Streaming response management should not be used when:

- **Complete response required before processing**: Applications that must analyze the entire response before taking action, such as structured data extraction, JSON parsing, or decision logic based on complete outputs. In these cases, streaming adds complexity without benefit since the application cannot proceed until generation completes anyway.

- **Synchronous workflow requirements**: Systems that need to perform sequential operations based on AI responses, such as generating a response and then immediately using it as input to another process. Streaming complicates these workflows by requiring incremental processing or buffering the complete response internally.

- **Client limitations**: Environments where clients cannot handle streaming responses, such as simple HTTP clients, batch processing systems, or legacy integrations that expect single-payload responses. These clients require complete responses and cannot display or process incremental tokens.

- **Network reliability concerns**: Environments with unreliable networks where connections frequently drop may experience worse user experience with streaming than with buffered responses. If connections routinely fail mid-stream, users must restart requests repeatedly rather than receiving complete responses via retry logic.

- **Comprehensive pre-delivery filtering**: When every token must be analyzed and approved before any content reaches users, such as highly regulated environments requiring complete content review. Streaming's core benefit of immediate delivery conflicts with requirements for pre-delivery approval of complete responses.

- **Simplified billing and auditing**: Organizations that require atomic, all-or-nothing billing where partial responses should not incur charges. Streaming complicates billing by creating partial response scenarios that require deciding whether to bill for incomplete generations.

Alternative approaches for these scenarios:

- Disable streaming and implement buffered response delivery with appropriate timeout values for your use case
- Use loading indicators and progress estimation to improve perceived responsiveness without streaming
- Implement server-side streaming that buffers completely before responding to clients, gaining provider-side benefits without client-side streaming complexity
