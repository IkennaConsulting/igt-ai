# AI model catalog and playground

## The problem

Developers building AI-powered applications face a bewildering landscape of model choices. Dozens of models exist across multiple providers—OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Cohere, Meta, and others—each offering different capabilities, context lengths, supported modalities, pricing structures, and performance characteristics. A developer needing to integrate AI functionality must answer complex questions: Which model supports vision analysis? Which offers the best cost-to-performance ratio for summarization? Which has the longest context window for document analysis? Which model handles code generation most effectively?

Without centralized model information, developers resort to researching each provider's documentation separately, manually comparing specifications across incompatible formats, and experimenting through trial and error. This friction slows development, leads to suboptimal model choices, and creates knowledge silos where different teams independently discover the same information.

The problem extends beyond initial selection. Models evolve constantly—providers release new versions, deprecate old ones, adjust pricing, and change capability limits. Developers struggle to stay informed about which models remain available, which have been superseded, and when their chosen models will face retirement. Testing prompts against different models requires maintaining accounts with multiple providers, managing separate API keys, and writing integration code for each provider's unique API format.

The lack of a unified discovery and experimentation interface creates unnecessary barriers between developers and the AI capabilities they need to build effective applications.

## Forces

Several competing forces make model discovery and selection challenging:

- **Model proliferation**: The AI ecosystem expands rapidly, with new models released monthly. Tracking capabilities across providers requires continuous research and creates information overload. Developers cannot reasonably maintain awareness of dozens of models without centralized references.

- **Heterogeneous capabilities**: Models differ along multiple dimensions including maximum context length (from 4K to 1M+ tokens), supported modalities (text-only, vision, audio, multimodal), special features (function calling, structured output, code interpreter), training data recency, and domain specialization. No single specification captures all relevant dimensions.

- **Cost complexity**: Pricing varies by orders of magnitude between models. A simple query might cost $0.0001 with a small model or $0.01 with a frontier model—a 100x difference. Input and output tokens often have different prices. Some providers charge for fine-tuning, embeddings, or API feature access separately. Developers need cost information upfront to make informed decisions.

- **Latency characteristics differ significantly**: Real-time interactive applications require sub-second response times, limiting viable model choices. Background processing tolerates slower, more capable models. Time-to-first-token matters for streaming responses. Latency depends on model size, provider infrastructure, and current load, making it difficult to predict without testing.

- **Use case matching is non-obvious**: Knowing that a model has 200K context length does not directly answer whether it excels at legal document analysis, creative writing, or customer support responses. Developers need use-case-oriented guidance, not just raw specifications.

- **Experimentation requires infrastructure**: Testing a prompt against different models traditionally requires creating accounts with multiple providers, obtaining API keys, writing integration code, and managing separate billing relationships. This overhead discourages experimentation and leads to premature model commitment.

- **Model versions and lifecycle management**: Providers release new model versions continuously and deprecate old ones on unpredictable schedules. Applications hardcoded to specific models face sudden breaking changes when versions retire. Developers need visibility into model lifecycles and migration paths.

- **Provider-specific capabilities create lock-in**: Advanced features like custom instructions, extended thinking modes, or vision analysis might only exist for specific providers. Discovering these capabilities requires provider-specific documentation, and using them creates vendor lock-in.

- **Discoverability vs. choice overload**: While comprehensive catalogs provide complete information, overwhelming developers with dozens of similar-seeming models creates analysis paralysis. Effective discovery requires balancing completeness with curated recommendations.

## Risk the pattern mitigates

This pattern primarily addresses **poor observability** from the [IGT-AI operational risks](../risks.md#poor-observability). When developers lack understanding of which models they're using and why, troubleshooting performance issues, diagnosing quality problems, and optimizing costs becomes nearly impossible. Without visibility into model capabilities and characteristics, teams cannot effectively monitor whether their model choices align with application requirements.

The pattern also mitigates **runaway costs** from the [financial risks category](../risks.md#runaway-costs). By providing clear cost information during model selection, developers can make informed decisions and avoid accidentally choosing expensive models for simple use cases. Understanding token pricing, context limits, and cost characteristics upfront prevents budget surprises and enables cost-conscious architecture decisions.

Additionally, the pattern reduces operational friction that indirectly impacts all AI risks. When developers can easily discover, compare, and test models, they make better choices that improve security (selecting providers with stronger data handling), enhance reliability (choosing models with proven uptime), and avoid vendor lock-in (understanding alternatives before committing).

## How it works

An AI model catalog and playground provides a centralized, searchable inventory of available models with comprehensive metadata and testing capabilities. The gateway acts as a single point of discovery and experimentation, abstracting away the complexity of multiple providers and API formats.

### Model catalog components

The catalog maintains detailed metadata for each available model:

**Core specifications**:
- Model identifier and version (e.g., "gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09", "claude-3-opus-20240229")
- Provider name and hosted region information
- Model release date and deprecation timeline
- Model family and generation context

**Capability metadata**:
- Maximum context length in tokens (input and output limits)
- Supported modalities: text, vision, audio, multimodal combinations
- Special features: function calling, structured output, code interpreter, web search, tool use
- Knowledge cutoff date indicating training data recency
- Language support beyond English
- Rate limits and quota information

**Performance characteristics**:
- Typical latency ranges (time-to-first-token and total response time)
- Throughput capabilities for batch processing
- Streaming support and behavior
- Token processing speed estimates

**Cost information**:
- Input token pricing (often per million tokens)
- Output token pricing (typically higher than input)
- Special pricing for cached context or prompt caching features
- Minimum charges or fixed costs per request
- Batch processing discounts or premium pricing for priority access

**Use case recommendations**:
- Suggested applications: conversational AI, summarization, code generation, data extraction, creative writing, analysis
- Domain specializations: legal, medical, financial, technical, general knowledge
- Quality characteristics: reasoning capability, factual accuracy, creativity, instruction following
- Comparative positioning against alternative models

**Quality and safety metadata**:
- Content moderation capabilities built into the model
- Bias and fairness evaluation results
- Hallucination tendency assessments
- Safety classification and risk profiles

### Searchable and filterable interface

Developers interact with the catalog through multiple discovery paths:

**Capability-based search**: Filter by required features such as "vision support" or "function calling" to narrow choices to models that meet technical requirements. Search by minimum context length to find models capable of processing long documents.

**Use case browsing**: Navigate by application type—customer support, document analysis, creative writing—to see recommended models for specific scenarios with explanations of why each model fits.

**Cost-optimized selection**: Sort by price to identify economical options, or filter by maximum cost per million tokens to stay within budget constraints. View cost comparisons across models for representative workloads.

**Performance-based filtering**: Find low-latency models for real-time applications, or identify high-throughput options for batch processing. Filter by region to optimize network latency.

**Comparison views**: Select multiple models to see side-by-side capability, cost, and performance comparisons in unified formats, eliminating the need to cross-reference separate documentation.

**Provider-agnostic organization**: Browse capabilities independently of which provider offers them. Discover that multiple providers offer vision-capable models with similar specifications, revealing alternatives and reducing lock-in.

### Integrated playground environment

The playground enables hands-on experimentation without leaving the gateway interface:

**Prompt testing interface**:
- Text input area for composing prompts
- System message configuration for instruction templates
- Parameter controls for temperature, top-p, max tokens, and other sampling settings
- File upload for testing vision or document analysis capabilities

**Multi-model execution**:
- Select one or more models to test simultaneously with the same prompt
- View responses side-by-side for quality comparison
- Compare response times and token consumption across models
- Identify performance and quality trade-offs through direct observation

**Response analysis**:
- Token count breakdown showing input vs. output token consumption
- Cost calculation showing exact price for the test request
- Latency measurement including time-to-first-token for streaming responses
- Quality assessment tools for evaluating response relevance and accuracy

**Prompt library and templates**:
- Pre-built example prompts for common use cases
- Best practice templates demonstrating effective prompting techniques
- Sharing and saving custom prompts for team collaboration
- Version history tracking prompt iterations

**API code generation**:
- Automatically generate API integration code based on playground experiments
- Support multiple programming languages (Python, JavaScript, Java, Go, etc.)
- Include authentication, error handling, and streaming examples
- Generate both provider-specific and gateway-abstracted code samples

### Prompt engineering guidance

Beyond model discovery, the catalog provides educational resources that help developers use models effectively:

**Prompting best practices**:
- Technique explanations: few-shot learning, chain-of-thought, role prompting
- Model-specific guidance on optimal prompting approaches
- Common anti-patterns and how to avoid them
- Prompt debugging strategies for poor responses

**Example gallery**:
- Curated examples of effective prompts for various tasks
- Before-and-after comparisons showing prompt improvements
- Annotated explanations of why specific prompts work well
- Community-contributed prompt patterns and recipes

**Capability documentation**:
- Detailed guides on advanced features like function calling
- Examples of multimodal inputs combining text and images
- Structured output format specifications
- Tool use and code interpreter demonstrations

### Model lifecycle tracking

The catalog maintains awareness of model evolution over time:

**Version management**:
- Current model versions with release notes explaining changes
- Deprecated models with sunset timelines and migration paths
- Preview or beta models with stability warnings
- Automatic notifications when applications use deprecated models

**Change tracking**:
- Price adjustments and effective dates
- Capability updates like context length increases
- Provider incidents affecting availability or performance
- New model releases matching existing use cases

**Migration assistance**:
- Recommendations for replacing deprecated models
- Capability gap analysis between old and new versions
- Testing workflows to validate migrations before production deployment

### Provider abstraction and normalization

The catalog presents information in consistent formats regardless of backend provider:

**Normalized metadata schema**: All models expose the same capability fields using standardized terminology, even though providers document features differently. Context length is always in tokens using consistent counting methods.

**Unified cost representation**: Prices normalize to comparable units (per million tokens) even when providers use different billing increments or currency formats.

**Abstracted access**: The playground uses a single API format for testing across providers, hiding differences in authentication, endpoint structure, and parameter names. Developers experiment without learning provider-specific integration details.

### Team collaboration features

Enterprise deployments often include team-oriented capabilities:

**Shared model selections**: Teams can bookmark recommended models for specific projects, creating curated subsets of the full catalog.

**Prompt sharing**: Developers share successful prompts and test results with teammates, building institutional knowledge about effective model usage.

**Access control**: Administrators can restrict which models are visible to which teams based on cost tiers, compliance requirements, or capability needs.

**Usage analytics**: Track which models are most popular within the organization, where experimentation happens before production deployment, and how playground usage correlates with actual API consumption.

## Contraindications

AI model catalog and playground patterns are not appropriate in certain scenarios:

**Centrally mandated model choices**: When organizational policy requires using specific models for compliance, security, or contractual reasons, a discovery interface that encourages experimentation may undermine governance. If all applications must use a single approved model, a catalog creates confusion rather than clarity.

**Highly restricted environments**: In air-gapped or classified environments where external model access is prohibited and only specific on-premises models are available, a general-purpose catalog provides no value. Documentation for the limited available models may be more appropriate than discovery interfaces.

**Single-provider organizations**: Companies committed to a single AI provider through enterprise contracts or strategic partnerships may find comprehensive multi-provider catalogs unnecessary. Provider-specific documentation might be more focused and relevant.

**Playground security concerns**: In highly regulated industries, allowing developers to enter potentially sensitive data into playground environments for testing may violate data handling policies. If playgrounds cannot guarantee data privacy, organizations must restrict or prohibit their use.

**Performance-critical integrations**: Applications with microsecond latency budgets cannot tolerate the overhead of gateway abstraction layers. Direct provider integrations bypass gateway catalog infrastructure, making centralized discovery less relevant.

**Model selection happens at architecture level**: For applications where model choice is a fundamental architectural decision made once during initial design, ongoing discovery through catalogs provides limited benefit. These systems might document the chosen model without needing comprehensive alternatives.

**Regulatory prohibitions on specific models**: In contexts where regulations restrict which AI systems can process certain data types (e.g., healthcare or financial regulations), catalogs must carefully control which models appear for which use cases. General-purpose catalogs without use-case-specific filtering can create compliance risks by exposing inappropriate model choices.

**Competitive sensitivity**: Organizations building AI products as competitive differentiators may not want to expose model selection information broadly to development teams, preferring to control knowledge about AI infrastructure choices.
